# The-Cognifyz-Technologies-Internship-Challenge-Repository-
Welcome to The Cognifyz Technologies Internship Challenge Repository, where I document my journey as a Data Science Intern at Cognifyz Technologies. This repository showcases my hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and geospatial analytics, demonstrating my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights.
🔍 Key Highlights:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated a dataset with 9,551 entries, identifying patterns, missing values, and distributions.
Data Pipelines: Engineered efficient data preprocessing workflows using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for enhanced model performance.
Predictive Modeling: Developed Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Regressors, fine-tuned with GridSearchCV for optimal accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using MAE, MSE, and R² scores, refining model interpretability and predictive power.
Geospatial Analysis: Utilized Folium and Geopandas to create interactive heatmaps analyzing restaurant distribution across India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.
Feature Engineering: Applied OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler, and SimpleImputer to transform categorical and numerical data for better ML outcomes.
Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate histograms, KDE plots, bar charts, and scatter plots, revealing key insights.
Class Imbalance Handling: Implemented upsampling, downsampling, and data augmentation techniques to correct imbalanced restaurant rating data.
Business Insights: Discovered industry trends, such as only 12.1% of restaurants offer table booking, while 25.7% provide online delivery, aiding strategic decisions.
Automated Data Preprocessing: Ensured high data integrity by automating checks for missing latitude and longitude values in geospatial datasets.
